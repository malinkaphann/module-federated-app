# Module-Federated Ecommerce Backend Application

**Backend App** and **User App** use [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/); 
so at first build, it takes some amount of time to finish; 
be patient! 

Best way to fix it is to only import those components' styles which are needed.
